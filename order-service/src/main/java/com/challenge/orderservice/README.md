**Order Fulfillment:**

* Order Creation: Implement an endpoint to create new orders. This could involve receiving customer information, selected products, and quantities.

* Inventory Deduction: Upon order creation, reduce the available quantities of the ordered products from your inventory. Make sure to handle cases where the requested quantity exceeds available stock.

* Order Processing: Implement a background service to process orders. This involves packaging the products, generating invoices, and preparing them for shipment.

* Shipping Integration: Integrate with shipping services (e.g., UPS, FedEx, ...) to calculate shipping costs, generate shipping labels, and provide tracking numbers.

* Email Notifications: Send email notifications to customers regarding order confirmation, shipment details, and estimated delivery dates.

* Payment Integration: If applicable, integrate with payment gateways to handle payments securely.

* Stock Replenishment: Implement mechanisms to automatically reorder products when their stock falls below a certain threshold.


**Order Tracking:**

* Tracking Number Association: Associate the generated tracking numbers with orders and store them in the database.

* Status Updates: Create endpoints to update order status at different stages (e.g., order placed, order shipped, order delivered).

* Real-time Tracking: Provide customers with real-time tracking information by integrating with shipping carriers' tracking APIs. This can be displayed on the customer's order page.

* Webhooks: Implement webhooks from shipping carriers to receive automatic updates about the status of shipped orders.

* Customer Portal: Create a customer portal where customers can log in and view their order history and current order statuses.

* Email/SMS Notifications: Send automated notifications to customers as their orders move through different stages, such as "shipped" or "out for delivery."

* Interactive Map: If applicable, provide an interactive map displaying the order's current location during shipping.

* Exception Handling: Implement processes to handle exceptions, such as delayed shipments or failed deliveries, and provide appropriate notifications to customers.
